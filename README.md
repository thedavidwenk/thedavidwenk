## Hi there 👋

I'm a customer insights driven Product Manager with 8 years of experience in Product Design. I recently graduated from Le Wagon's intensive Web Development bootcamp where I developed an end-to-end web application platform to connect developers. I'm passionate about bridging the gap between design and business, leveraging user insights to drive strategic decisions and create seamless products. Feel free to reach out for any collaborations or projects.
