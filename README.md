## Welcome 👋

I'm a b2b product designer who loves to explore coding with personal projects. I'm passionate about bridging the gap between design and technology.

- Co-developed the web application platform [DevBuddy](https://github.com/thedavidwenk/devbuddy) with Rails to connect developers, focusing on streamlined user interactions and efficient matchmaking algorithms.
- Created a costume rental platform [Costumize](https://github.com/thedavidwenk/costumize), which integrates user-friendly search and booking features.

I'm passionate about bridging the gap between design, business, and technology, leveraging user insights to drive strategic decisions.
