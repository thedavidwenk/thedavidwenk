## Hi there 👋

I'm a customer-centric Product Developer and Design Technologist with 8 years of experience in Product Design. I recently graduated from Le Wagon's intensive Web Development bootcamp where I:

- Co-developed the web application platform [DevBuddy](https://github.com/thedavidwenk/devbuddy) with Rails to connect developers, focusing on streamlined user interactions and efficient matchmaking algorithms.
- Created a costume rental platform [Costumize](https://github.com/thedavidwenk/costumize), which integrates user-friendly search and booking features.

I'm passionate about bridging the gap between design, business, and technology, leveraging user insights to drive strategic decisions. 

**Feel free to reach out for any collaborations or projects!**
