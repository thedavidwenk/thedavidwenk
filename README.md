## Hi there 👋

Customer-focused Product Manager with 8 years of experience in Product Design. I recently graduated from Le Wagon's intensive Web Development bootcamp where I developed an end-to-end web application platform to connect developers. I'm passionate about bridging the gap between design and business, leveraging user insights to drive strategic decisions and create seamless products.
